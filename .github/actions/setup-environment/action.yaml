# Oh, hey, you are are probably wondering why I don't use GitHub's Action Variables?
# 
# * They are not in source control, and just create more places to we have to manually
#   manage things: Did we spell it right? Do I have permission to edit it? etc.
# * There are some variables (like SHORT_SHA) that have to be computed anyway,
#   so why not just set all the "global" things in one place.
# * Settings don't show up in a code search, making them harder to validate and maintain.
#   "Is this the project with the extra options?" "Did I miss one?" etc.
